#Welcome to KEKChain !
#What is KeK Chain
A cryptocurrency system that supports smart contracts without the scalability and privacy limitations of earlier systems like Ethereum. KEK, like Ethereum, allows parties to create smart contracts using code to specify the behavior of the virtual machine (VM) that executes the contract's function.Loop Network strives to solve scalability and usability issues, without compromising decentralization, and leverages the existing developer community and ecosystem. It is an off-chain/external scaling solution for existing platforms to provide scalability and superior user experience for DApps/user features.
#What is KEK Chain?
KEK Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with KEK Chain using an innovative consensus of Proof of Stake and Authority(PoSA)
How does KEK Chain work? What is the architecture and consensus used?
 Chain relies on a system with Proof of Stake and Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.
There will be fewer validators on KEK Chain testnet.
Can you tell more about Proof of Staked Authority(PoSA)? What is it?
PoSA is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner
What are the benefits for developers to build on KEK Chain?
EVM-compatible: KEK Chain supports all the existing Ethereum tooling Fast block time, cheaper cost

    Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: ApuSwap remains a liquid venue of exchange of assets on KEK Chain"

What are the benefits for developers to build on KEK Chain?
KEK Chain opens the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading
What make KEK Chain different?
Key Innovations:
Proof-of-Stake and Authority Consensus
Native Cross-Chain Communication using Bridge

    Expand the use cases of KEK token

KEK Chain is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?
EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to KEK Chain.
Can developers make hybrid Dapps using both KEK Chain and BNB Chain in one single Dapp?
Yes, with the help of native cross-chain functions
